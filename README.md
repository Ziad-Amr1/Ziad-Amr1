## About Me
I'm a frontend developer who cares deeply about UI clarity, layout logic, and pixel-level consistency.  
I build reusable component systems and responsive interfaces with an emphasis on spacing, alignment, and pragmatic design.  
My background in backend and automation (Node.js, Python) informs how I structure data flow and integrate APIs.

---

## Highlights
- UI-first mindset with focus on composition, spacing, and readability  
- Component-driven architecture with reusability in mind  
- Strong sense for responsive layouts and cross-browser polish  
- Comfortable bridging frontend and backend concerns  
- Interest in applying software practices to BIM workflows and automation

## How I Work
- I iterate visually: prototypes → components → responsive refinement  
- I prioritize accessible, semantic HTML and utility-first styling  
- I prefer small, focused components with clear props and minimal side effects  
- I use automation and scripts for repetitive tasks and build optimizations
